"\t\t\t\t<p>OpenTracker runs several times faster than older tracker implementations and requires less memory. (For example, it runs fine with the limited resources of many embedded systems.) Several instances of the software may be run in a cluster, with all of them synchronizing with each other. Besides the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) opentracker may also be connected to via User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which creates less than half of the tracker traffic HTTP creates.[1] It supports IPv6, gzip compression of full scrapes, and blacklists of torrents. Because there have already been cases of people being accused of copyright violation by the fact that their IP address was listed on a BitTorrent tracker,[2] opentracker may mix in random IP address numbers for the purpose of plausible deniability.</p>\n"
